MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT(ORM)
ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping. It's a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems: object-oriented programming languages and relational databases. In the context of Python and SQL databases:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): In languages like Python, data is organized into objects with attributes and methods. Object-oriented programming allows for modeling real-world entities as objects, providing a natural way to represent and manipulate data.

Relational Databases (SQL): SQL databases store data in tables, which consist of rows and columns. Each row represents a record, and each column represents a field or attribute of that record. SQL databases use a structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data.

ORM bridges the gap between these two paradigms by allowing developers to work with database data in an object-oriented fashion, using familiar concepts like classes, objects, and inheritance. Instead of writing raw SQL queries, developers can interact with the database using high-level programming constructs.

In Python, popular ORM libraries include SQLAlchemy and Django's ORM. These libraries provide tools for defining database models as Python classes, mapping those classes to database tables, and performing database operations (such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records) using Python syntax. ORM libraries handle the translation between objects and relational data, making database interactions more intuitive and efficient for Python developers.
